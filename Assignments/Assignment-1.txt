8.What is async and defer?

They both are attributes used to define how to deal with scripts in HTML.
Async=> simultaneously parsing HTML tags and fetch data from network, once data gets into browser it stops parsing the html tags and peform script actions and resume once script is completed.

     PARSING HTML               again PARSING HTML
    ------------->             ----------->
         fetching  Executes scripts
         -------->------------->

 Defer=> It paralley parses and fetches the scripts data from network and execute only after completion of all parsing html.

      PARSING HTML               
    ------------------------>
        fetches                   Executes scripts
          -------->           --------------->

when scripts are dependent on each other, prefer defer bcz it maintains Order whereas async doesnt maintain any order.
